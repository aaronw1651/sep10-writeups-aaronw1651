### Introduction
#### In this project, I'm exploring the use of Bootstrap to create a dynamic and visually appealing web page based on the "Invincible" universe. Bootstrap provides a strong framework for responsive design and component styling.

### Experiences while Learning Bootstrap
#### Working with Bootstrap has been a significant learning experience. I learned how to control the grid system to create responsive layouts, that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes. Using Bootstrap's components, like cards and modals, has streamlined the development process and allowed me to focus more on the page's content and overall design.
